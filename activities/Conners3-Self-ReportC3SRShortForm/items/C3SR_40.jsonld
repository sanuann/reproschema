It never (or seldom) happened. 1= In the past month, this was JUST A LITTLE TRUE about me. It happened occasionally. 2= In the past month, this was PRETTY MUCH TRUE about me. It happened often (or quite a bit). 3= In the past month, this VERY MUCH TRUE about me. It happened very often (very frequently).  It is important to respond to every item.
