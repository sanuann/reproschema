All of the questions should be answered by marking one of the answer spaces. If you don't find an answer that fits exactly, use one that comes closest. If any question does not apply to you, or you are not sure what it means, just leave it blank. Some of the questions have the following format: EXAMPLE: The Seatle Storm is a good basketball team. No! no yes YES! Please mark in the circle which of the four words best describes how you feel about that sentence. Mark (the BIG) YES! if you think the statement is definitely true for you. Mark (the little) yes if you think the statement is  mostly true for you. Mark (the little) no if you think the statement is mostly not true for you. Mark (the BIG) NO! if you think the statement is definitely  not true for you. ",
